# Tributech DataSpace Kit resource ontology

The DataSpace Kit (DSK) follows the approach to describes all entities of the system and relations between them using well known standards.

The supported standards are:
- [Digital Twins Definition Language (DTDL) Version 2](https://github.com/Azure/opendigitaltwins-dtdl/blob/master/DTDL/v2/dtdlv2.md)
- [Web of Things (WoT)](https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description/)

The definitions can be found in the corresponding sub-folders [DTDL](./DTDL) and [WoT](./WoT).
